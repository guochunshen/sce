The \pkg{sce} package for spatial community ecology
}
\description{
This is a summary of the features of \pkg{sce}, a package in \code{R} for the spatial explicit anaylsis of community ecology.
}
\details{
Currently, it deals mainly with populations and community data type.

The package supports
\itemize{
    \item creation, manipulation and plotting of patterns of populations and communities
    \item exploratory data analysis 
    \item simulation of populations under various null models
    \item parametric model-fitting
    \item hypothesis tests and model diagnostics
  }
}
\section{Functions and Datasets}{
Following is a summary of the main functions and datasets in the \pkg{sce} package. Alternatively an alphabetical list of all functions and datasets is available by typing \code{library(help=sce)}.

For further information on any of these functions, type \code{help(name)} where name is the name of the function or dataset.
